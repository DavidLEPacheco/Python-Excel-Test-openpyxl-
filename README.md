# Python-Excel-Test-openpyxl-
A simple python program which reads data from an excel spreadsheet

Make sure to change the directory name to the directory in which the excel spreadsheet "Test.xlsx" is located. If you clone this repository it will be in the same folder as the python program, but it can be any directory. The python and excel files do not need to be in the same folder.

For this code to work, you will need openpyxl. To get it on windows:

1. First Install pip. To do  this, go to https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
2. Copy and paste the text into a text file, save it as get-pip.py
3. Open cmd and browse to folder where get-pip.py is installed 
4. Run the following command: python get-pip.py
5. Now, run the following command: pip install openpyxl. This will install openpyxl on your computer. You're good to go!
6. Include 'import openpyxl' in any python file you make which needs to interface with excel.
